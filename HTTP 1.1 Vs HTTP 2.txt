Differnce between HTTP 1.1 Vs HTTP 2 


HTTP 1.1

1.HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it

2.HTTP/1.1 server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it.

3.Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.but HTTP/1.1 is slower than HTTP 2.

HTTP 2
1.HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.HTTP/2 allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it. It is applicable for modern webpages

3.HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.So it is faster than HTTP/1.1
